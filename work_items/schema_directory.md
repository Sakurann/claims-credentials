# Schema Directory

The DIF Schema Directory will act as a source of curated references to aid 
developers in finding schemas that address their needs. When seeking to add 
to the directory, the group will first seek out existing schemas from external 
sources that cover the motivating need for the addition. If no schema exists 
externally that addresses the need, the group may elect to generate and publish 
new schemas and publish them within the directory project/repo.

## Work Item Owners
- Daniel Buchner (@github, email@example.com, or both)

## Outcome
This will be a long-lived work item, but an indication of success will be that 
we have assembled a directory with enough coverage across a wide enough array 
of use cases and verticals that it becomes well-known in the wider community 
as valuable place to look for schemas when questions arise about which to use 
in a given circumstance.

## Deliverables
- Process for evaluation and inclusion of a new schema category or reference
- Initial directory populated with a significant enough number of schemas to provide value
- Publication of the directory on the DIF website

## Meetings
- Meetings will be held once a month, with async eval of PRs for additions being 
  the primary mode of collaboration.
- Meetings will primarily be focused on review of any outstanding issues.
- Recordings of meetings will be published to the same sheet other WG meetings are.
